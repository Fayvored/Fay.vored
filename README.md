## ** My Approach**
My approach is characterized by a blend of technical rigor and empathetic understanding:
1.  **Contextualization:** I start by deeply understanding the business problem or cultural challenge, ensuring the data analysis directly addresses a strategic need.
2.  **Rigor:** I prioritize **data quality, integrity, and statistical soundness** in all my analysis.
3.  **Visualization & Storytelling:** I don't just present numbers; I craft a clear narrative around the data, making complex insights accessible and compelling for non-technical audiences.
4.  **Action Orientation:** The goal of every project is to deliver *recommendations* that lead to measurable, positive change in people processes and business outcomes.
